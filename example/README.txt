This directory contains input files that have small taxonomies and trees for 
Primates. These can be useful for testing the routines for creating and 
manipulating the graph db (without being overwhelming because of scale).

files:
"col_primates.txt" - The primate portion of the CoL taxonomy (with first entries
     modified to insert the root above Primates).

"ncbi_primates.txt" - The primate portion of the NCBI taxonomy (with first entries
     modified to insert the root above Primates).

"sarich_wilson_1967.tre" - tree from Sarich and Wilson's classic paper on Hominid
    relationships based in dissimilarity measured by cross-reactivity of 
    antigens against albumins

"grehan_schwartz_2009.tre" - to show how the GoL system works with conflicting 
    phylogenetic estimates, this tree from Figure 2A of Grehan and Schwartz 
    (2009) is included. This includes the unconventional grouping of humans
    as sister to orangutans.
